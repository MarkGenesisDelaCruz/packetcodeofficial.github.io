<div align="justify">
    <p style="color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Hello my name is <strong>Mark Genesis M. Dela Cruz </strong>I was born and brought up in a very adorable and lovely family.
    <sup>2</sup> I am the only child of my parents.
    <sup>3</sup>I spent a lot of my childhood with my grandparents and  neighbourhood friends.
    <sup>4</sup>I used to play a lot with my friends. 
    <sup>5</sup> I remember each and every game of basketball we used to play together.
    <sup>6</sup>Every moment is very precious to me.
    <sup>7</sup>In the afternoon, we used to play tag,hide and seek and many more game in our nearby ground.
    <sup>8</sup>The memories of playing in the ground together are mesmerising. 
    <sup>9</sup> Another beautiful thing I can remember is flying kites. 
    <sup>10</sup> It used to be one of the most exciting things of my childhood. 
    <sup>11</sup>Even the older members of the family participated with us. 
    <sup>12</sup> We used to fly kites in the empty yard beside our house.
    <sup>13</sup> Another thing i can remember is we go to rice field to catch fish and frag and ofcourse after we fry them it will be our dinner.
    <sup>14</sup> We also go to river for our family picnic moments it such a amazing moment.
    <sup>15</sup> We also bathe in the river and we lit our boonfire at night .
    <sup>16</sup>It feels so refreshing to relive them again and again. 
    <sup>17</sup>  My childhood memories are very close to my heart and make me smile on my difficult days.
    <sup>18</sup> The pleasure of outdoor games in all kinds of weather, getting wet in the rain or soaking with sand, can never come back again. 
    <sup>19</sup> The golden days were tension free and care free from all sorts of duties and responsibilities.
    <sup>20</sup> Even the fights had its own charms.</p></div>

<div align="right">
    <p><dd><sup>1</sup>I want to take <samp>aeronautical</samp> engineering in college but due to financial problem it holds me back from becoming a engineer.
    <sup>2</sup>I started my college year during the second semester in 2018.
    <sup>3</sup>I chose to take IT in UE because it's my second choice and i think there's also a lot of good opportunities if i will become a good programmer.
    <sup>4</sup>I will not forget my first year memorable college life experience. 
    <sup>5</sup>The pleasures of college life, the joy, college life with friends are one of the best days of my life.
    <sup>6</sup>I already missed the food in Gastam,  sisig and chicken wings.
    <sup>7</sup>Also the times when me and classmates hangout together, it's really amazing to thing about the good things that happened to me.
    <sup>8</sup>The most important thing is the lessons that i learned in school.
    <sup>9</sup>It teaches me the tough skills of life, discipline, joy and commitment.
    <sup>10</sup>I also realize a lot of things like life is not as easy as i thought.
    <sup>11</sup>No one tells me what to do.
    <sup>12</sup>It's a big adjustment, i must  learn to adapt to my surroundings.
    <sup>13</sup>I start to feel independent and it grows my confidence but unfortunately things became different.
    <sup>14</sup>In 2020 corona virus spread in many parts of the world including our country. 
    <sup>15</sup>It changes a lot of things specially in my college year.
    <sup>16</sup>I stopped my schooling for 1 year because my parents don't want me to attend online class because they think it's a experiment and it's not worth it.
    <sup>17</sup>In 2021 i decided to study again because i realize that it's a new a normal and we need to accept it.
    <sup>18</sup>Until now I am attending to our online class and it's very different experience compare to the face to face class. 
    <sup>19</sup>The only thing that makes me happy during this new normal is that I'm with my parents. 
    <sup>20</sup>But in my mind i also want to finish my college in school and experience the things that most of the students from the past experienced.</dd></p></div>
